This is a collection of very simple number-theory related tools
and a very simple RSA encryption and cracking tool.

'ntheory.rb' - this contains various simple utility algorithms.
- GCD, EGCD, Totient, Coprimality.
- Modular exponentiation (and a simple equivalent which handles
  this similarly to how it is done by hand.)
- Simple prime factorisation.
- Miller-Rabin primality test.

'rsaenc.rb' - this contains a simple RSA encryption tool.
'rsaenc-cmd' - this can be run to actually encrypt things.

'rsasolve.rb' - this is a simple solver for RSA
	      	(uses the tools above to decrypt messages with
		their public key).
